A basic delay example, with an additional option to use a phasor to playback from the delay line. 

The original code for the basic delay example, written in C, can be found in "The Audio Programming Book" (Richard Boulanger
& Victor Lazzarini) Chapter 6.8. This chapter describes the role of the circular buffer and the basic logic behind
programming a delay line.
